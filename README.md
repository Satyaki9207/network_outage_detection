# Project Description
India is seeing an explosion of new competitors in the Broadband space. 'India Broadband' is a company that is now seeing a lot of customer churn due to customer dissatisfaction because of broadband outages. The company has now curated a dataset, where it tracks several variables that it believes impact the `outage_duration`. They have tracked three different outage durations, `0` for no outage, `1` for short outages that last anywhere between a few minutes and a maximum of 2 hours, and `2` for long outages that can last from 2 hours to sometimes even a couple of days. The objective is to build a machine learning model to predict outages and reduce customer churn.
